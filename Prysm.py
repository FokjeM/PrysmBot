"""
A utility bot for Discord.
This is the v2 rewrite, which uses actually proper code and tries to make it
as sleek and lightweight as possible. Try not to use or run anything that isn't
required and try not to use more resources than necessary.

Generator functions are better than duplicating code, since they leave a smaller
memory footprint and should be small, fast tasks that can be mostly asynced.
